CHAPTER-1
LIGHT-REFLECTION AND REFRACTION
------------------------------- <br> <br> <br>



-REFLECTION OF LIGHT-

><bold>The phenomena of bouncing back of light rays in the same medium on striking a smooth surface is called reflection of light.</bold> <br>

-LAWS OF REFLECTION-

There are two laws of reflection:
<bold>1-Angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection</bold>
<bold>2-The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</bold><br>

-IMAGE-

>If the light rays coming from a point  after reflection meet at another point then the second point is called the image of the first point. <br>

1-REAL IMAGE-

<bold>
>if the light rays coming from one point actually meet after reflection then the image is called real image.</bold><br>

-properties-

>Image can be caught on a screen or a wall.<Br>
>Image is always inverted.<br>
>Image is formed Infront of the mirror.
<br>
2-VIRTUAL IMAGE-

>If the light rays coming from one point after reflection does not meet at another point but appears to meet at another point then the image formed is a virtual image.
<br>
-properties-
<br>
>Image is always erect.<Br>
>Image is formed behind the mirror<br>
>Image cannot be caught on a screen.<br>

<br>-MIRROR-

>mirror is a polished surface which reflects almost all the light that's reflected on it. <br>

-SPHERICAL MIRRORS-

>if the reflecting surface of the mirror is curved inwards or outwards then the mirror is called a spherical mirror.<br>

-CONCAVE MIRROR-

>the spherical mirror which is curved out ward is known as concave mirrors.<br>

-uses-<br>

>Used for shaving mirrors.<br>
>Used by doctors to focus a parallel beam of light on the patients organs.<Br>
>used in a solar furnace.<Br>
>Used as reflectors in head lights of automobiles. <br>

-CONVEX MIRRORS-

>the spherical mirror which curved inward is known as convex mirrors.
<br>
-uses-<br>
<br>
>Used as junction mirrors.<Br>
>Used as rear view mirrors in vehicles.<br>
<br>
-RULES FOR OBTAINING IMAGE FORMED BY A CONCAVE MIRROR-<br>

1-A ray of light incident parallel to principle axis after reflection passes through principle focus.<br>
2-An incident ray of light which passes through the principle focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principle axis.<Br>
3-A ray of light which passes through the centre of curvature after reflection re-traces its path back.<br>
4-A ray of light incident at pole and making an angle with the principle axis after reflection goes on the other side of the principle axis making the same angle with it.
<br>
-RULES FOR OBTAINING IMAGE FORMED BY A CONCAVE MIRROR-<br>

1-a ray of light incident parallel to principle axis after reflection appears to come from principle focus.<br>
2-A ray of light directed towards the principle focus  after reflection becomes parallel to principle axis.<br>
3-A ray of light directed towards the centre of curvature after reflection re-traces its path back.<br>
4-A ray of light incident at the pole and making an angle with the principle axis after reflection goes on the other side of the principle axis making the same angle with it.
<br>
-REFRACTION OF LIGHT-<br>

>the bending of light when it passes through one transparent medium to another transparent when light incident obliguely.<br>
>When light travels from a rarer medium to denser medium, it bends towards the normal.<br>
>when light travels from denser to rare , it bends away from the normal.<br>
<br>
-LATERAL DISPLACEMENT-

>the perpendicular distance between the emergent ray and incident ray, when the light passes out of a glass slab is known as lateral displacement.
<br>
-LAWS OF REFRACTION-

There are two laws
<bold>1-The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal, to the incidence of 2 transparent mediums at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.<br>
2-(Snell's law)The ratio of sin of angle of incidence to the sin of angle of refraction for light of given pair of medium. This is called Snell's law.</bold>
<br>
-LENS-

>Lens is a transparent medium bounded by 2 surfaces of which one or both surfaces are spherical.
<br>
-CONVEX LENS-

>A lens which is thicker at the centre and thinner at its end is known as convex lens. It is also know as converging lens.
<br>
-RULES FOR OBTAINING IMAGES FORMED BY CONVEX LENS-<br>

1-A ray of light proceeding parallel to principle axis after refraction it passes through principle focus.<br>
2-A ray of light passes through the principle focus of a convex lens after refraction it becomes parallel to the principle axis.<br>
3-A ray of light passes through optical centre of a convex lens emerges without any deviation.<br>

<bold>-CONCAVE LENS-</bold>

>A lens which is thinner at the centre and thicker  at its ends is known as concave lens. It is also known as diverging lens.
<br>
<bold>-RULES FOR OBTAINING IMAGES FORMED BY A CONCAVE LENS-</bold>><br>

1-A ray of light proceeding close and parallel to the principle axis after refraction it passes through the lens appears to diverge from principle focus. 
<br>2-A ray of light directed towards the principle focus of a concave lens after refraction become parallel to the principle axis.<br>
3-A ray of light passes through the optic centre of the lens emerges without any deviation.<br>

<bold>-REFRACTIVE INDEX-</bold>

>The refractive index of a medium is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.
<br>
<bold>-POWER OF A LENS-</bold>
<br>
<bold>>Power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length in metre. It is the measure of degree of divergence of light  rays falling on it.
