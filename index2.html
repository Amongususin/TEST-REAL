OUR ENVIORNMENT
---------------
<br>
<bold>- ENVIORNMENT-</bold

>It is our surrounding where we live. Both physical and biological place where we live in.
<br>
<bold >-WASTES-</bold> 

>Wastes that are dumped by humans disturb the balance of the environment.
>There are two types of wastes:
<br>
<bold>-BIO DEGRADABLE-</bold

>Waste materials which can be broken down into non poisonous substance by the action of microbes.
>Eg-Plant watse, animal dung
<br>
<bold>-NON BIO DEGRADABLE-</bold

>Substance not broken down by the action of microbes.
>Eg-plastic
<br>
<bold>-ECOSYSTEM-</bold>

It is our surrounding along with  biotic and abiotic components. Interact among themselves for a healthy environment.
<br>
<bold>-NATURAL ECOSYSTEM-</bold

>Ecosystem Developed by nature.
<br>
<bold>-ARTIFICIAL ECOSYSTEM-</bold

>Ecosystem developed by man.
<br>
<bold>-BIOTIC COMPONENTS-</bold

>All living things 
>Biotic are again separated on the basis of their action...
<br>
<bold>-PRODUCERS-</bold>

>They provide energy for other living things. Plants are in this section.
<br>
<bold>-CONSUMERS-</bold
<br>
>They consume other organisms.<br> 
>There are different consumers...<br>
>Herbivores<br>
>Carnivores<br>
>Omnivores<br>

<bold>-DECOMPOSERS-</bold
    <br>
>Microorganisms which breakdown the complex organic compounds present in dead organisms into simpler substances.
>It acts as a cleaning agent of the ecosystem.
<br>
<bold:>-FOOD CHAIN-</bold>
<br>
>It is the sequence of living organisms in a community in which one organism consumes another organism to transfer food energy.<br>
>The original source of food is plant.<br>
>Transfer of energy takes place in one direction and also energy does not revert back.<br>
<br>
<bold>-TROPIC LEVEL-</bold>
    <br>
>Various steps involved in a food chain at which transfer of energy takes place are called tropic levels.<br>
>Energy flow is decreasing with the increase of tropic level.<br>
<br>
<bold>-FOOD WEB-</bold>
<br>
>The interconnected food chains operating in a ecosystem which establish a network of relationships between various species is called food web.
<br>
<bold>-BIOLIGICAL MAGNIFICATION-</bold><br>
>The process of increasing in the concentration of toxic chemicals with the increasing tropic level in a food chain is called biological magnification.<br>
>Example- harmful chemicals or poisonous substance such as DDT sprinkled to kill pest on plants enter the food chain.<br>

<bold>-OZONE-
</bold<br>
>Free oxygen molecule is present, the UV radiation will act on oxygen molecule as a result oxygen molecule detached to form two free oxygen atoms.<br>
 this free oxygen atom will go and bind with any other oxygen molecule and it form another compound o3.This o3 compound is called ozone.<br>
>It will make a protective layer.<br>
>It will protect the earth from UV radiation.<br>
>This layer is depleting because of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC).This CFC will go and make holes in the ozone layer.<br>
>Eye diseases, skin cancer etc. will be caused by this.<br>

<bold>-PREVENTION-</bold><br>

>Government takes many measures to prevent the production of CFC.<br>
>Nowadays refrigerators and air conditioners are coming with non harmful gases.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<bold>EXTRA QUESTIONS</bold>
---------------<br>
Q-How is energy flow decreased by every increasing tropic level?<br>

Q-What do you mean by food web?<br>

Q-How does the concentration of toxic chemicals increase with every tropic level?<br>
<br>
Q-Name a chemical which is used to kill pests on plants, that enter the food chain.<br>

Q-What is ozone layer, why is it depleting? How can we decrease the damage caused to our ozone layer each day?<br>
